# random-features-banach
This repository contains the code associated with the journal articles "The Random Feature Model for Input-Output Maps between Banach Spaces" ([SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 43 (2021), pp. A3212â€“A3243](https://doi.org/10.1137/20M133957X)) and "Operator learning using random features: a tool for scientific computing" (to appear in SIAM Review, 2024). It implements the function-valued random features method for two operator learning benchmark problems: 1) the solution operator of 1D viscous Burgers' equation and 2) the solution operator of the 2D Darcy flow elliptic partial differential equation.

> We recommend that users interested in the operator random features method migrate over to that repository. The current repo `random-features-banach` should only be used to reproduce the results in the journal papers and not used for future developements.
